						<p>The greater part of the New Jersey soldiers&#8217; time was occupied by such mundane duties as mounting guard, cutting wood, and maintaining garrisons in several towns in the area. There were occasional opportunities during this period for excitement or at least a change in the mundane rounds of daily living. In August 1778 General George Washington directed Brigadier General Maxwell to station a party of fifty men in Monmouth County &#8220;at some place &#8230; most convenient for commanding a view of the Hook and its environs; in order to watch the motions of the Enemy&#8217;s Fleet and to advise me from time to time of every thing that passes &#8230;&#8221; By and large this duty must become routine after the men had settled in to their new environs, but to break the monotony there were occasional forays against &#8220;Wood Tories,&#8221; a popular term for local inhabitants Loyal to the crown. One attempt to capture them or &#8220;burn their Cabin&#8221; was made around the end of August, and on the 30th the 2nd New Jersey&#8217;s Major Richard Howell, commander of the observation post, moved with his men to forestall a rumored Loyalist attack at &#8220;the Sale of Ship and Cargo at Toms River&#8221;; the outcome is unknown.1</p>
<p>Unfortunately<br />
Major Howell&#8217;s party was less than the fifty men the commander in<br />
chief had recommended. On 9 October the major wrote from &#8220;Tinton<br />
falls&#8221; that &#8220;As to parties of Observation alas I have but<br />
thirty men [which is] insufficient to guard our little post &amp; am<br />
&#8230; unable to detach a party on so dangerous a command but obligd to<br />
expose my person every Day alone.&#8221; Howell&#8217;s detachment remained<br />
on this duty until January 1779. In reference to a force of &#8220;250<br />
Men from the line, properly officered, to go upon that service&#8221;<br />
of stopping the trade between Monmouth and New York, Washington<br />
stated on 9 January &#8220;There will be no necessity of Major<br />
Howell&#8217;s remaining in Monmouth &#8230; be pleased therefore to direct him<br />
to join his Brigade, with the Men that are with him as soon as they<br />
arrive &#8230;&#8221; 2</p>

<p>Head Quarters,<br />
August 8, 1778.</p>
<p>Sir: I am<br />
uncertain whether you may not already have a party somewhere in<br />
Monmouth County, but however this may be, it is my wish you should<br />
without delay have one of 50 Men stationed under a very vigilant and<br />
intelligent Officer at some place in that County most convenient for<br />
commanding a view of the Hook and its environs; in order to watch the<br />
motions of the Enemy&#8217;s Fleet and to advise me from time to time of<br />
every thing that passes, of all Vessels that arrive to them, or go<br />
out from them. Lieut. Colo. Brearly, 37 Ray 38 or Major Howel 39<br />
would either of them be very proper for this business. I would wish<br />
the Officer who is to have the charge of the party to go instantly on<br />
and his party to follow as soon as possible. If you have any Militia<br />
Horse it would be desireable to send a few with him, and to remain<br />
with the party.</p>
<p>[Note 37:<br />
Lieut. Col. David Brearley, of the First New Jersey Regiment. He<br />
resigned in August, 1779.]</p>
<p>[Note 38:<br />
Lieut. Col. David Rhea, of the Fourth New Jersey Regiment, who had<br />
retired in July, 1778.]</p>
<p>[Note 39: Maj.<br />
Richard Howell, of the Second New Jersey Regiment. He resigned in<br />
April, 1779.]</p>
<p>For conveying<br />
any important intelligence with dispatch, I inclosed you a letter to<br />
Mr. Caldwell40 directing him to station expresses at proper distances<br />
between the party you send and</p>
<p>[Note 40: Rev.<br />
James Caldwell.] Elizabeth Town; and I shall expect whenever it comes<br />
to you, you will not lose a moment in forwarding it to me, by a<br />
trusty hand, on whose activity and care you can depend; and when<br />
there is any thing particularly interesting you will send duplicates<br />
for fear of accidents. As the obtaining good and certain intelligence<br />
is a matter of great importance to us, I must intreat you to continue<br />
your other exertions for procuring such as may be depended on. I am<br />
&amp;ca.</p>
<p>P.S. I just now<br />
recd. your favor of yesterday and the intelligence it contains<br />
respecting the Fleet seems so certain that it cannot well admit of a<br />
doubt. Yet should it be otherwise, I must request you to give me the<br />
very earliest information of it. The importance of such a<br />
circumstance you must be fully sensible of, and therefore I make no<br />
doubt you will upon similar occasions have the fullest proof, before<br />
you hand it to me as fact. I have transmitted a copy of that part of<br />
your letter which Count D&#8217;Estaing is so materially interested in, to<br />
him. You will be pleased to Seal the inclosed before you forward<br />
it.41</p>

<p>Dear Sir: On<br />
Wednesday afternoon I received your favor of the 12th58 and 13th<br />
Inst. by Mr. Hulet the Pilot, who did not arrive in Camp &#8217;till then.<br />
I am much obliged by your particular relation of matters, and request<br />
that you will continue it from time to time whenever opportunity will<br />
permit.</p>
<p>[Note 58:<br />
Greene&#8217;s letters of August 12 and 13 are not found in the Washington<br />
Papers.]</p>
<p>There is one<br />
circumstance in your relation, of which I was exceedingly sorry to<br />
hear.59 You will readily know which it is. I wish the utmost harmony<br />
to prevail as it is essential to success; and that no occasions be<br />
omitted on our part to cultivate it.</p>
<p>[Note 59: At<br />
this date misunderstandings and antagonism were already existent<br />
between the American and French officers.]</p>
<p>Your operations<br />
have been greatly retarded by the late violent storm; but as it is<br />
now over, I trust things will go on prosperously and that you will be<br />
rejoined by Count D&#8217;Estaing who has been kept out so long by it.<br />
Indeed from General Sullivans Letter of the 17th., I flatter myself<br />
you will have made a compleat reduction of the Enemy&#8217;s force before<br />
this reaches you, and that the next advices I receive will announce<br />
it. If the fact is otherwise, let me beseech you to guard against<br />
Sortee&#8217;s and surprizes. The Enemy, depend upon it, will fall like a<br />
strong Man, will make many Sallies, and endeavor to possess<br />
themselves of, or destroy your Artillery; and in one of these, they<br />
once put the Militia into confusion, the consequences may be fatal.</p>
<p>By a Letter<br />
which I received yesterday from General Maxwell, inclosing one from<br />
Major Howell,60 (who I have stationed at black point for the purpose<br />
of observn) it appears certain, that Sixteen of Lord Howe&#8217;s fleet<br />
entered the Hook on the 17th.</p>
<p>[Note 60: Maj.<br />
Richard Howell, of the Second New Jersey Regiment.] That on that, and<br />
the preceeding day, there had been heard severe Canonades at Sea, and<br />
that it was reported in New York that a 64 Gun Ship and several<br />
Transports had been taken by the French Squadron. I wish the fact may<br />
be so as to the capture, and that the Count may be with you to give a<br />
narrative of it himself. I cannot learn that Admiral Byron is<br />
arrived, nor do I believe that he is. It is said that one Ship only<br />
of the Cork Fleet is yet arrived. I have not time to add more, as<br />
Majr. Blodget61 is in a hurry to proceed, than to assure you that I<br />
am, etc.62</p>
<p>[Note 61: Maj.<br />

<p>Head Quarters,<br />
Fredericksburg, October 22, 1778.</p>
<p>My Lord: I am<br />
favd. with yours of the 19th. and 20th. with their inclosures, and<br />
thank you for the important and particular intelligence which you<br />
have communicated. I must now beg of you to continue your endeavours<br />
to find out whether a total evacuation is intended, or a Garrison to<br />
be left in New York. If the latter, the Knowlege of the number of<br />
Troops, the Corps, and the ships of War will be very essential. If<br />
your expresses can with safety cross to South Amboy, your<br />
communication with Major Howell will be much more expeditious.</p>
<p>If you obtain<br />
any material intelligence, I shall be obliged to you for transmitting<br />
it immediately to Congress; but I would just hint to your Lordship<br />
the necessity of mentioning to the president what information they<br />
may give to the public as authentic, if they chuse to publish: As I<br />
see they have printed a postscript to one of your letters, in which<br />
you speak of the evacuation of Fort Independence as a report only.</p>
<p>If the small<br />
detachment of Major Lee&#8217;s has not yet left you, be pleased to send<br />
them forward to join their Corps.</p>
<p>I have informed<br />
Govr. Livingston that you would afford him any assistance in your<br />
power in collecting evidence of the surprise and Massacre of part of<br />
Colo. Baylor&#8217;s Regt. I am etc.75</p>

<p>A letter from<br />
George Washington to Benjamin Tallmadge in reference to paying Aaron<br />
Woodhull alias Samuel Culper and finding a more expedient route for<br />
transmitting intelligence through Col. Shreve or Gen Maxwell both of<br />
which Richard Howell already was sending intelligence through. This<br />
letter is dated 21March 1779 and Richard Howell resigned in April<br />
1779.</p>

<p>Middlebrook,<br />
March 21, 1779.</p>
<p>Sir: With this<br />
Letter you will receive Fifty Guineas for S&#8211; C&#8211;r,93 which you will<br />
cause to be delivered as soon as possible, with an earnest<br />
exhortation to use them with all possible oeeconomy, as I find it<br />
very difficult to obtain hard money.94</p>

Samuel Culper, spy, alias of Aaron Woodhull.]</p>
<p>[Note 94: The<br />
following receipt, in the writing of Washington, follows this letter<br />
in the Washington Papers: &#8220;Middlebrook, March 21, 1779. Then<br />
received from General Washington the Sum of Fifty Guineas (in Gold)<br />
to be delivered to S&#8211; C&#8211; for the purpose of secret intelligence<br />
from New York. Benja. Tallmadge.&#8221;]</p>
<p>I wish C&#8211;<br />
could fall upon some more direct channel by which his Letters could<br />
be conveyed, as the efficacy of his communications is lost in the<br />
circuitous rout. if he could fall upon a method of conveying his<br />
Letters to Genl. Maxwell at Elizabeth town, or to Colo. Shreve at<br />
Newark, they would come to me with more dispatch, and of consequence<br />
render his corrispondance more valuable.</p>
<p>As all great<br />
movements, and the fountain of all intelligence must originate at,<br />
and proceed from the head Quarters of the enemy&#8217;s army, C&#8211; had<br />
better reside at New York, mix with, and put on the airs of a Tory to<br />
cover his real character, and avoid suspicion. In all his<br />
communications he should be careful in distinguishing matters of<br />
fact, from matters of report. Reports and actions should be compared<br />
before conclusions are drawn, to prevent as much as possible,<br />
deception. Particular attention is to be paid to the arrival, and<br />
departure of all Fleets, and to the alterations in the cantonements<br />
of the Troops and their respective movements with the destination of<br />
them, if to be come at, and before it is too late to profit by the<br />
knowledge. All reinforcements, whether of whole Corps, detachments,<br />
or recruits (for the purpose of filling their Regiments) to be<br />
carefully marked, and the numbers, description, &amp;ca. properly<br />
designated. All detachments and the strength and destination of them<br />
to be scrutinized with an eye equally attentive. The temper and<br />
expectation of the Tories and Refugees is worthy of consideration, as<br />
much may be gathered from their expectations and prospects; for this<br />
purpose an intimacy with some well informed Refugee may be political<br />
and advantageous. highly so will it be, to contract an acquaintance<br />
with a person in the Naval department, who may either be engaged in<br />
the business of providing Transports for the embarkation of the<br />
Troops, or in victuelling of them. Many other things will occur upon<br />
reflection without an enumeration of them: I shall therefore only add<br />
my wishes that the whole may be placed on such a footing as to answer<br />
the end most effectually, and that I am Sir Yr., etc.</p>
<p>P S I wish<br />
merely for curiosity, and that I may be prepared with sufficient<br />
knowledge, for any future favourable contingency, to know the depth<br />
of Water through Hell gate? the largest Ship of war that has ever<br />
passed it? and the largest that can pass it?95</p>

<p>Letter from<br />
General Washington to Alexander Mcdougall concerning double agents<br />

looking for ways to gain reliable intelligence.</p>

<p>Head Quarters,<br />
Middle Brook, March 25, 1779.</p>
<p>Dear Sir: I<br />
duly received your favour of the 20th instant. Mr. H&#8211;20 has just<br />
delivered me that of the 22nd. [The Letter and inclosures referred to<br />
in it are not yet come to hand.] I have had a good deal of<br />
conversation with Mr. H&#8211;. He appears to be a sensible man capable of<br />
rendering important service, if he is sincerely disposed to do it.<br />
From what you say, I am led to hope he is; but nevertheless, if he is<br />
really in the confidence of the enemy, as he himself believes to be<br />
the case, it will be prudent to trust him with caution and to watch<br />
his conduct with a jealous eye.</p>
<p>[Note 20:<br />
Elijah Hunter, assistant commissary of forage, at Bedford, N. Y.]</p>
<p>I always think<br />
it necessary to be very circumspect with double spies. Their<br />
situation in a manner obliges them to trim a good deal in order to<br />
keep well with both sides; and the less they have it in their power<br />
to do us mischief, the better; especially if we consider that the<br />
enemy can purchase their fidelity at a higher price than we can. It<br />
is best to keep them in a way of knowing as little of our true<br />
circumstances as possible; and in order that they may really deceive<br />
the enemy in their reports, to endeavour in the first place to<br />
deceive them. I would recommend, that the same rule should be<br />
observed in making use of Mr. H&#8211;, who notwithstanding the most<br />
plausible appearances may possibly be more in earnest with the enemy<br />
than with us. By doing this we run the less risk and may derive<br />
essential benefit. He is gone on to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Inclosed is a<br />
copy of a resolve of Congress of the 15th., which so far as it<br />
affects the troops under your command you will be pleased to assist<br />
me in executing as speedily as possible. I am, etc.21</p>

<p>Headquarters,<br />
Middlebrook, March 25, 1779.</p>
<p>Sir: I was<br />
favored with the receipt of your letter of the 17th. inst. [If you<br />
have any] know[ledge] of the country which lays between Niagara and<br />
our settlements. [I shall be obliged by your] delineating with as<br />
much exactness as you are able, the different Indian villages, the<br />
best routes which lead to them; their names, the nature of the<br />
[country whether hilly or swampy] the waters and such obstructions as<br />
may be in the way. You will distinguish between what you know from<br />
actual observation and what you may have drawn from the accounts and<br />
observation of others. [take no notice of my having made these<br />
enquiries.] You will be pleased to grant a flag in the present<br />
instance for the flour and beef for the use of the State prisoners in<br />
the hands of the enemy. But mention to Mr. Boudinot as the business<br />
is of a State nature it may in future be most eligible to obtain<br />
provisions from the Governor, [which when obtained will be sufficient<br />
for you to grant a Flag on.</p>
<p>I hope your<br />
intercourse with New York is not totally at an end. I have heard<br />
nothing from there of a long while, not from you since the 17th. Have<br />
you not yet heard what Fleet that it was appeared off the Hook last<br />
week? from whence and the contents?, and what the Enemy appear to be<br />
abt. in the City?]</p>

takes this letter carries the Commissions for the officers of your<br />
